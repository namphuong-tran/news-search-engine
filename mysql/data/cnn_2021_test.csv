One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.

Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

No sleep

TuSimple's latest road test involved hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City. The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself.

""Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,"" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO.

The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. ""In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,"" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard.

Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.

Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available , TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software.

""We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,"" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls ""virtual railroads,"" and nowhere else.

According to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024.

Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads.

Happier drivers?

The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver.

""If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,"" he said.

That doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the ""middle mile,"" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. ""A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,"" said Lu.

TuSimple's autonomous fleet.

Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving.

""Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,"" said Lu.

No distractions

Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple has prominent competitors, such as Google spinoff Waymo and Uber-backed Aurora, but those are working on a wider range of self-driving vehicles, including passenger cars. TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark.

Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. ""The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,"" he said.

Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night.

""In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,"" said Lu. ""The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.""",https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/world/tusimple-autonomous-truck-spc-intl/index.html

SII is also expanding its partnerships, having signed a deal with American biotech firm Novavax to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, which is awaiting regulatory approvals.","As Covid-19 wreaked havoc around the world last year, the 39-year-old son of an Indian billionaire was laying the groundwork for a plan he hoped would eventually end the pandemic.

Adar Poonawalla — the CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker — pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his Indian manufacturing facility and committed to make millions of doses of a then-unproven coronavirus vaccine.

That vaccine, created by Oxford University and, was still in clinical trials at the time. Nobody was sure how long a vaccine would take to develop, let alone whether it would even work.

""It was a calculated risk,"" Poonawalla told CNN Business. ""But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.""

Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India, chose to commit to making a vaccine while it was still in clinical trials.

To make his plan work, Poonawalla first had to raise nearly $1 billion. And the lives of hundreds of millions of the planet's most vulnerable people were at stake, since SII had pledged to provide poorer countries with jabs. If the gamble paid off, Poonawalla would save countless lives and be hailed as a hero during a period of historic turmoil. His fabulously rich family also would stand to grow even more wealthy by profiting from a significant deal.

As the world gave its money — and trust — to Poonawalla, things seemed to be going according to plan. The AstraZeneca vaccine received approval from UK regulators in December 2020, and Poonawalla became a household name in India.

""It was a calculated risk. But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another."" SII CEO Adar Poonawalla, on committing his company to make millions of doses of a then-unproven Covid vaccine

But soon it became evident how badly Poonawalla had miscalculated the challenges that come with distributing millions of vaccines in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic.

His company's ability to inoculate even his own countrymen was thrown into doubt earlier this year as a devastating wave of coronavirus hit India. He's also failed to keep up with his commitment to deliver shots to other nations — the consequences of which have dented his reputation and shed light on the perils of such heavy reliance on one manufacturer.

From horse breeders to vaccine makers

It's easy to see why some of the biggest names in public health chose to rely on Poonawalla.

Few manufacturers can come close to the scale at which SII is able to produce vaccines. The company — which was founded by Poonawalla's father, Cyrus, 55 years ago — produces 1.5 billion vaccines each year for measles, rubella, tetanus and many other diseases. The jabs are mainly distributed to low-income countries worldwide, including India. Poonawalla estimates that just over 50% of the world's babies depend on vaccines made at SII.

The Poonawalla family charted an unusual path to becoming one of the world's preeminent vaccine makers. They have bred and raced thoroughbred horses since the 1940s, diversifying into pharmaceuticals, finance and real estate over the last half-century.

Cyrus Poonawalla is now India's seventh-richest man, worth more than $16 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. His son Adar took over as CEO in 2011 and has focused on expanding in international markets

To prepare for the AstraZeneca vaccine production, Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on buying chemicals, glass vials and other raw materials, as well as ramping up manufacturing capacity at his plant in the Western Indian city of Pune.

Gates Foundation, which SII other countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance. More than $250 million came from the company's own funds. Another $300 million came from the Bill and MelindaGates Foundation, which SII collaborated with to provide discounted or free doses to low-income countries. The rest was paid byother countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance.

All of that happened, though, before regulators signed off on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Had trials for that vaccine been unsuccessful, SII would ""just be making batches and then end up throwing them away,"" Poonawalla said.

Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on materials including chemicals and glass vials to prepare for vaccine production.

A business studies graduate of London's University of Westminster, Poonawalla said SII was able to make that decision more swiftly than many other companies, since it is a family-run business.

""The flexibility of being able to decide on the spot very quickly was really the main game-changer that enabled us to be able to do this,"" said Poonawalla, whose office in India is a refurbished Airbus A320

After UK regulators approved the vaccine, Poonawalla began supplying doses to Indians and other other countries. By May, Gavi had received some 30 million jabs from SII.

India's Covid-19 tsunami

But Poonawalla's plans soon went awry when a second wave of Covid-19 hit India in the spring. At its peak the country was reporting over 400,000 cases per day, though experts say the actual number was likely much higher.

At that point, only 2% percent of India's 1.3 billion population was fully vaccinated, and the country's national government had been slow in placing orders for more vaccines. Without a massive stockpile, states in India began to run out of the limited number of jabs they had.

India then decided to stop the export of all vaccines, preventing SII from keeping up with its commitments elsewhere.

A brutal second wave of Covid-19 hit India in spring 2021.

""I've always been a patriot for my country ... and if my country needs my facility first, I have to do what they say,"" Poonawalla said. ""There was no two ways about that.""

warned India's hold on exports could be "" The inability to export vaccines hurt some of the poorest nations in the world. The director of Africa's disease control body, for example,warned India's hold on exports could be "" catastrophic "" for the continent. People in several countries, from neighboring Nepal to Kenya , were left stranded after receiving the first dose of Covishield, the name of the India-manufactured vaccine.

When asked why the global vaccine alliance chose to rely so heavily on one manufacturer, a Gavi spokesperson told CNN Business it had few options.

At the start of 2021, ""very few vaccines were approved and available for deployment,"" the spokesperson said, adding that it was ""natural"" that SII would be contracted for early doses given its size.

But public health expert Jeffrey Lazarus said there were flaws in the plan.

""Relying on one manufacturer was a mistake, which is easier to see in hindsight,"" said Lazarus, who heads the health systems research group at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health.

Being held to account

While Poonawalla cannot be held responsible for some of the issues that led to the vaccine rollout stalling — chief among them, India's massive outbreak — his detractors have questioned parts of his approach.

They point out Poonawalla hasn't delivered the number of jabs he initially promised, and they claim he hasn't been transparent about how he's been using all of the money he raised for the big vaccine push.

""There isn't much accountability for where the money he raised went,"" Malini Aisola, co-convenor of health sector watchdog All India Drug Action Network, told CNN Business.

In June last year, SII pledged it would make one billion doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine for low and middle income countries, with 400 million doses ready by the end of 2020.

But by January 2021, the company had a stockpile of just 70 million doses . His critics weren't impressed, given the amount of capital he raised last year.

SII declined to comment on the amount it has made from its vaccine production so far. Poonawalla called it ""very unreasonable and naive"" for people to expect companies not to profit from these efforts.

The global media coverage also turned unfavorable , with headlines linking the global shortfall in vaccines to SII's problems, including the India export ban and a fire at the company's Pune facility. At the time Poonawalla said the fire had no effect on Covishield production. But he has since reversed course, saying that the incident has played a major role in hampering manufacturing.

He also insists he was realistic about his goals. ""We always underpromise,"" Poonawalla told CNN Business, when asked whether the company pledged more than it could deliver.

Still, he's been dogged by other controversies that have dented his reputation. As India's Covid-19 cases were skyrocketing in April, Poonawalla lowered the price of his vaccine and referred to the move as a "" philanthropic gesture "" — leading to heavy criticism, with activists pointing out that even a small profit is still a profit for SII.

""AstraZeneca has pledged that it won't make profits from low income and middle income countries during the pandemic, but that does not seem to apply to SII,"" Aisola said.

According to AstraZeneca, the companies the drugmaker has sublicensing agreements with, including SII, dictate their own prices.

SII declined to comment on how much it has profited from the vaccine efforts so far, but Poonawalla said it is a ""very unreasonable and naive way of looking at the world"" for people to expect companies not to profit from the vaccine.

about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company. While Poonawalla has yet to match his lofty goals, there is a chance that he and SII can get back on track, which is critical to ending vaccine inequality worldwide. India has decided to begin exporting vaccines once again as its own rate of inoculation increases. The nation had administered one billion doses by October —about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company.

SII also says that it has increased its production to 220 million doses a month as of October.

SII is also expanding its partnerships, having signed a deal with American biotech firm Novavax to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, which is awaiting regulatory approvals. It's also partnering with the Russian Direct Investment Fund on production of the Sputnik vaccine.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/02/business/adar-poonawalla-risk-takers/index.html

Now, Asia's third largest economy is ready for the next big frontier in tech: Coming up with a new generation of software companies like Zoom or Slack.

The Covid-19 pandemic has forced business around the world to make huge investments in digital infrastructure, furthering the influence of companies providing software-as-a-service, or SaaS. Businesses spent an extra $15 billion per week last year on tech as they scrambled to create safe remote working environments, according to a KPMG survey

SaaS companies provide web-based applications that take care of everything from how secure the software is to how well it performs. Some of the world's most well-known SaaS companies include, SAP Concur and, the American behemoth that owns workplace messaging app Slack

India's software-as-a-service industry could be worth $1 trillion in value by 2030 and create nearly half a million new jobs, according to a recent report compiled by consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and SaaSBoomi, a community of industry leaders.

There are nearly a thousand such companies in India, of which 10 are unicorns, or startups worth at least $1 billion, the report said.

India's best-known SaaS company. It filed for an ""This can be as big an opportunity as the IT services industry was in the 90s,"" said Girish Mathrubootham, CEO of Freshworks,India's best-known SaaS company. It filedfor an IPO last month, joining a string of other major Indian tech unicorns that are going public this year.

Freshworks was founded more than a decade ago in the southern Indian city of Chennai. Like Salesforce, it provides software to help companies manage relations with their customers. It's also India's oldest unicorn in the sector, having raised funds from investors such as Tiger Global and Accel, and has more than 50,000 customers. The company was last valued at $3.5 billion in a 2019 funding round, according to data firm Tracxn.

Indian SaaS firms have found traction by focusing on niche businesses. for example, is a unicorn that builds software for the spa and beauty salon industry. OtherIndian SaaS firmshave found traction by focusing on niche businesses. Zenoti for example, is a unicorn that builds software for the spa and beauty salon industry.

Of India's 10 SaaS unicorns, six reached that milestone in 2020, and investors around the world are paying attention. Last year, investors pumped $1.5 billion into Indian SaaS companies, four times more than in 2018 or 2019, according to the SaaSBoomi report.

Bullish investors

Investors are excited about SaaS because of the ""massive adoption"" of software over the last decade, according to Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director of Sequoia Capital India.

Girish Mathrubootham, CEO and founder of Freshworks, a ""SaaS"" or ""Software-as-a-service"" company founded in Chennai, India.

While India is a small player in the global SaaS market, investors say the country could eventually dominate the sector because of two things: its vast pool of English-speaking developers, and the relatively low cost of hiring them.

Thanks to the rise of India's IT industry, software engineering has become one of the most sought-after career options in the country.

""India actually has one of the largest developer communities in the world,"" Bhatnagar told CNN Business. Many of them have worked at some of the biggest global tech companies.

Abhinav Asthana, the co-founder of Postman, pointed to his experience working as an intern at Yahoo in Bengaluru as instrumental in the decision to build his product.

He came up with the idea to build a tool that would simplify the API (Application Programming Interface) testing process. An API is a programming code that defines how two applications communicate with each other, and Postman says it has made it easier for engineers to work together as they design and build their APIs.

""We saw how software was created at these global companies, and we saw API was a key problem,"" Asthana told CNN Business.

Now, Postman is India's most valuable SaaS unicorn, with a valuation of $5.6 billion.

Almost 98% of Fortune 500 companies use Postman's products, according to Asthana, while Freshworks' first client was based in Australia.

SaaS firms are much better placed to go global than e-commerce companies like India's Flipkart, for example. They write software once, and then are able to use it multiple times.

""For a Flipkart you need billions of dollars [to grow internationally], but for a Freshwork you need much less capital to go global,"" said Mathrubootham, who is also an investor in Postman. This is because e-commerce firms require a ton of money to set up physical operations elsewhere — they have to hire delivery drivers, rent warehouses and buy inventory.

Bhatnagar of Sequoia Capital said that Indian software entrepreneurs ""mastered"" the art of ""remote sales"" fairly early. ""Honestly, in this last two years, the whole world has had to understand how to do better remote sales,"" he added.

Indian engineers trained in the IT services industry may find it hard to develop the discipline required to build a product-focused company.

In IT services, ""you are selling bodies and you say yes to everything the customer says,"" said Krishnamoorthy. SaaS companies, on the other hand, have to say no to 99% of [potential] customers, he added.

And India's startup ecosytem is still relatively immature when compared to Silicon Valley. Despite the massive size of some homegrown unicorns, Mathrubootham said that the country does not have a ""global tech powerhouse product brand.""

But he hoped that future SaaS companies can change that.
